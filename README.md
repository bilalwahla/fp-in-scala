This is a project about improving my Scala skills as I study through the the book by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason. 

When one is new to a functional programming language, paradigm shift, a different way of thinking about programs and using those programs to solve problems, 
I believe, is quite a lot to take in. Introducing yourself to this very different style of programming demands practising the usage of especially monads 
amongst other things. 

I have used TDD approach so that I not only understand explained concepts as well as I could but understand their applications in a way that I can refer 
back to them easily. TDD offers a great playground to do just that.
